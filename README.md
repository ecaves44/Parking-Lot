# Parking-Lot
A class project of writing a program to park different types of vehicles for certain parking spots.
There are 8 classes: Main class, ParkingLot, Levels, Spots, Vehicle, Large, Car, Motorcycle
There are a total of 30 spots, 3 rows "levels" each with 10 spots. Of these 10 spots, are Large, Car, and Motorcycle indicated spots.
Motorcycle can park in any spot, Car can park in Large or Car spot, but not in Motorcycle. Large can only park in Large.
When a Bus is parked, it takes up 5 Large spots, so a max of 3 buses can be in the Parking Lot at any one time. 
Vehicle is the parent superclass of the other 3 vehicle types.
